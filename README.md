# BBC_News-PHP
This is my PHP project with phpMyAdmin database which consists of two tables(news and users). 
This project consists of several pages, has the possibility of viewing news by category and can be clicked on each article. 
There is also a login to the site and if we have admin rights, we can edit and do crud operations on the news articles.
You will need XAMPP i order to see this web application.
